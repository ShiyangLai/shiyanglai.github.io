|  I'm Shiyang Lai. I'm a 1st year Ph.D. student at the Sociology department of the Universi-|
|ty of Chicago. I'm also a visiting fellow at the Kellogg School of Management at Northweste-|
|rn University.                                                                              |
|                                                                                            |
|                                    MY RESEARCH AGENDA                                      |
|  I do research under three topics:                                                         |
|    a) Human-AI Ecology                                                                     |
|       I develop free-formed AI collectives and explore an ecological solution to superalig-|
|       nment, existential risks, and Human-AI co-evolution. For more details, check my proj-|
|       ect folder: `cat projects/eco-ai/intro.txt`.                                         |                                         
|    b) A Quantum Explanation of the Scoial World                                            |
|       I scratch the Theory of Social Superposition to explain complex, multi-facet social  |
|       entities and the interaction between observation and social realities. In this theory|
|       , I model social entities as Schr√∂dinger's cats and social world as a manifold compr-|
|       ising multiple coupled sub-social systems... For more details, you can:              |
