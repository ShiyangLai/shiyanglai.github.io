|  I'm Shiyang Lai, a 1st year Ph.D. student at the Sociology department of the University o-|
|f Chicago. I'm also a visiting fellow at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern U-|
|niversity this year.                                                                        |

|                                    MY RESEARCH AGENDA                                      |
|  I do research under three topics:                                                         |
|  a) Human-AI Ecology                                                                       |
|     I develop free-formed AI collectives and explore an ecological solution to superalignm-|
|     ent, existential risks, and Human-AI co-evolution. For more details, check my project  |
|     folder: `cd projects/eco-ai/`.                                                         |
|                                                                                            |
|  b) A Quantum Explanation of the Scoial World                                              |
|     I scratch the Theory of Social Superposition to explain complex, multi-facet social en-|
|     tities and the interaction between observation and social realities. In this theory|
|       , I model social entities as Schrödinger's cats and social world as a manifold compr-|
|       ising multiple coupled sub-social systems... For more details, check my project fold-|
|       er: `cd projects/soc_sup/`.                                                          |
|                                                                                            |
|    c) Science of Science                                                                   |
|       I work with Prof. James Evans on constructing a global observatory and virtual labor-|
|       atory for U.S. science and technology advancement. We build new deep-learned, chrono-|
|       logically-trained, context-sensitive large language models to construct a data-drive-|
|       n “digital double” of the global techno-scientific system. For more details, check my|
|       project folder: `cd projects/sos_lm/`.                                               |
