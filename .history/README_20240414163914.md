|  I'm Shiyang Lai. I'm a 1st year Ph.D. student at the Sociology department of the Universi-|
|ty of Chicago. I'm also a visiting fellow at the Kellogg School of Management at Northweste-|
|rn University.                                                                              |
|                                                                                            |
|                                    MY RESEARCH AGENDA                                      |
|  I do research under three topics:                                                         |
|    a) AI collectives                                                                       |
|       I explore an ecological solution to superalignments, existential risks, and human-AI |
|co-evolution. How could we grow AI as an autonomous species rather than subordinate tools?  |
|How could we build up an organic ecological niche for AI and guarantee mutualism interaction|
| between human and AI?
