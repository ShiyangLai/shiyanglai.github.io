|  I'm Shiyang Lai. I'm a 1st year Ph.D. student at the Sociology department of the Universi-|
|ty of Chicago. I'm also a visiting fellow at the Kellogg School of Management at Northweste-|
|rn University.                                                                              |
|                                                                                            |
|                                    MY RESEARCH AGENDA                                      |
|  I do research under three high-risk-high-reward topics                                    |
|    a) Human-AI ecology                                                                     |
|       I explore an ecological solution to superalignments, existential risks, and human-AI |
|    co-evolution. How could we grow AI as an autonomous species rather than subordinate too-|
|    ls? How could we build up an organic ecological niche for AI and guarantee mutualism hu-|
|    man-AI interaction? To address these questions, I establish a virtual biosphere to host |
|    mini AI societies and simulate different approaches for human to interact with autonomo-|
|    us AI agents and the long-term consequences.
