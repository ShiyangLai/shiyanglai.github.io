|  I'm Shiyang Lai. I'm a 1st year Ph.D. student at the Sociology department of the Universi-|
|ty of Chicago. I'm also a visiting fellow at the Kellogg School of Management at Northweste-|
|rn University.                                                                              |

|                                    MY RESEARCH AGENDA                                      |
|  I do research under three topics:                                                         |
|    a) Human-AI Ecology                                                                     |
|       I explore an ecological solution to superalignment, existential risks, and Human-AI  |
|    co-evolution. How could we grow AI as an autonomous species rather than subordinate too-|
|    ls? How could we build up an organic ecological niche for AI and guarantee mutualism hu-|
|    man-AI interaction? To address these questions, I establish a virtual biosphere to host |
|    mini AI societies and simulate different approaches for human to interact with autonomo-|
|    us AI agents and investigate the long-term consequences...                              |
|    b) A Quantum Explanation of the Scoial World                                            |
